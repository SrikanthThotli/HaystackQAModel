American entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates co-founded the Microsoft Corporation with his partner Paul Allen in 1975. Microsoft is one of the worldâ€™s earliest tech companies and is based out of Washington, US. It is currently headed by India-born, Satya Nadella.
Bill Gates (full name: William Henry Gates III) was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington, U.S. His father was a lawyer and his mother was a member of the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. His software skills were first exhibited at the age of 13 when he wrote a software program on a General Electric computer. The program was a basic version of tic-tac-toe, where a human could play against machine.
While in high school, he was a part of programmers that computerised the schoolâ€™s payroll system. He is said to have read the â€˜World Book Encyclopediaâ€™ in his teenage years. Interestingly, Bill Gates is a drop out from Harvard University. He left the university in 1975 to join his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to work on softwares for microcomputers. In the same year, Microsoft was founded. Eventually, Microsoftâ€™s own operating system MS-DOS was licensed to IBM, the then worldâ€™s biggest computer supplier. The operating system was used in IBMâ€™s first microcomputer, IBM PC.
In 1986, Gates became a billionaire and almost decades later, his total worth reached tens of billions of dollars making him one of the worldâ€™s richest man.
The American computer programmer is widely known for his charitable work. He, along with his wife Melinda, established the William H. Gates Foundation in 1994. It was renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999.
In 2014, he stepped down from the Microsoftâ€™s chairman position and devoted himself to the philanthropist work. He was awarded the foremost U.S. civilian decoration, Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

Times Newspaper in Education (Times NIE) is a novel program that helps students â€˜Stay Aheadâ€™ and aims at making â€˜Learning Funâ€™. It introduces concepts that help individual growth and development beyond school curriculum.
A brainchild of The Times of India, the worldâ€™s leading English newspapers, Times NIE nurtures progress and innovation. Adapted from the international concept, Times Newspaper in Education program (Times NIE) was initiated in India in 1985.
Today we have over 3000 schools and over 9 lac students subscribing to the programme, spanning 16 cities viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Lucknow, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, and Jaipur.
The Times of India Student edition, a customized student newspaper exclusively for the students, packs a powerful punch in terms of content that leads to a smarter and superior learning experience. The information is crafted such that it finds use in classroom discussions, thus making it relevant and current. It truly gives education a new dimension by fostering the simple habit of reading which in turn paves the way for a confident, informed and aware individual. A newspaper that inspires young minds and equips them to face challenges of todayâ€™s world, making way for global citizens.
Empowering students with new cutting-edge knowledge through various educative and informative activities is a commitment and tradition of Times NIE. The programme serves as a catalyst of education and interaction, as well as a window into the minds of the quintessential Indian youth. On a significant scale Times NIE comprises diverse interesting activities and events that boost the childâ€™s passion for learning, while revealing hidden talent.
While you are aware that The Times of India is among the leading English Newspapers across the world, it has consummated its position as an everlasting winner. With several international awards and recognitions to its credit, The Times of India and Times NIE have validated an enduring tradition of setting the highest benchmarks in every respect.
We have been awarded with the two most prestigious awards, Times NIE - Worldâ€™s No.1 NIE program and The Times of India, Student Edition - Worldâ€™s No.1 Newspaper for the youth in 2006 by the celebrated World Association of Newspapers (WAN). In 2008 we were honoured by the International Newspaper Marketing Association (INMA), yet another international recognition for â€˜Youth Audience Developmentâ€™. In 2013 we were again honoured by the celebrated World Association of Newspapers (WAN) as the â€˜Times NIE - Worldâ€™s Best Youth Engagement Programâ€™.
Times NIE has grown remarkably over the last three and a half decades, touching millions of children across more than 16 Indian cities. Our absolute commitment towards the fledgling generation remains undiluted and our greatest strength lies in the school partnership and commitment.
